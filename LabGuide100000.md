## Part 1. Registering a Target Database
- You can register Autonomous Databases and DB systems in the Oracle cloud with Oracle Data Safe. The following table lists the supported cloud databases, their versions, and whether public or private IP addresses for the databases are supported.
https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/data-safe/udscs/target-database-registration-overview.html#GUID-10B10D3D-8807-4778-8C91-80AEE4F7F4F0 use this table
- For this lab we will be registering an Autonomous Database
### **Step 1:** 
- To register an Autonomous Database with Oracle Data Safe, you require permissions in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management (IAM), on the database, and in Oracle Data Safe.
- Permission in IAM to access to the database. The user group to which you belong requires at least the **inspect** permission on the **autonomous-database** resource type. For example, to grant the **Data-Safe-Admins** group the **inspect** permission on all Autonomous Databases in the **Finance** compartment, a tenancy administrator could write the following policy statement:
allow group Data-Safe-Admins to inspect autonomous-database in compartment Finance <!-- See how to add code snippet copy on md-->

- Permission to log in to the database as an administrator. You need to be able to log in as a PDB administrator (ADMIN) or as a user that has execute permission on the DS_TARGET_UTIL package in order to grant additional roles to the DS$ADMIN service account for Oracle Data Safe.
- Permission to manage at least one feature in Oracle Data Safe. The user group to which you belong needs to be granted the manage privilege on at least one feature in Oracle Data Safe (Assessment, Activity Auditing, or Discovery and Masking) so that you can register, update, and delete target databases for that feature.

### **Step 2:** 
- By default, your Autonomous Database comes with a database account specifically created for Oracle Data Safe named DS$ADMIN. - The roles that you grant to this account determine the Oracle Data Safe features that you can use with your Autonomous Database. By default, the DS$ASSESSMENT_ROLE and DS$AUDIT_COLLECTION_ROLE roles are already granted. These particular roles allow you to assess users and security configurations on your Autonomous Database and start audit trail collection immediately after you register the database.

- The following table describes the available roles for Autonomous Databases.
Use the table here https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/data-safe/udscs/register-autonomous-databases-that-have-public-ip-addresses.html#GUID-1026A408-2D57-420C-927B-588948C2A89C

- To grant or revoke roles from the Oracle Data Safe service account on an Autonomous Database database, you can run the DS_TARGET_UTIL PL/SQL package on the Autonomous Database. You need to run this package as the PDB Admin user (ADMIN) or as a user that has execute permission on the DS_TARGET_UTIL PL/SQL package.

- You can grant or revoke roles as often as needed.
- Using a tool like SQL*Plus or SQL Developer, log in to your Autonomous Database as the PDB Admin user (ADMIN) or as a user that has execute permission on the DS_TARGET_UTIL PL/SQL package.
- Grant or revoke a role from the Oracle Data Safe service account by running one of the following commands:
EXECUTE DS_TARGET_UTIL.GRANT_ROLE('role_name');
or
EXECUTE DS_TARGET_UTIL.REVOKE_ROLE('role_name');
- where role_name is the name of an Oracle Data Safe role. role_name must be in quotation marks.

### **Step 3:** 
- You can register an Autonomous Database from its Console in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console. From this Console, you can also access the Oracle Data Safe Console.

- Sign in to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.<!-- Add login console images if skipping lab 0-->
- In the upper right corner, select the region in which your Autonomous Database resides.
- From the navigation menu, select **Autonomous Data Warehouse** or **Autonomous Transaction Processing**.
- From the **COMPARTMENT** drop-down list, select the compartment that contains your Autonomous Database.
- Click the name of your Autonomous Database. The **Autonomous Database Information** tab on the **Autonomous Database Details** page is displayed.
- Under **Data Safe**, click **Register**.
- A Confirm dialog box asks if you are sure you want to register the database with Oracle Data Safe.
- Click **Confirm**. Wait for registration to finish.
- When registration is completed, the **Status** reads **Registered**. A resource group is created in Oracle Data Safe with the same name as the compartment that contains the database in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. The user registering the database is automatically authorized to manage the User Assessment, Security Assessment, and Activity Auditing features for that resource group.
- (Optional) Click **View Console** to navigate to the Oracle Data Safe Console for the database.

## Part 2. Assess Database Configurations with Oracle Data Safe
-	Using Oracle Data Safe you can assess the security of a database by using the Security Assessment feature and fix issues.
### **Step 1:** 
-	In the Oracle Data Safe Console, generate a Comprehensive Assessment report

-	When the report is generated, review the high risk, medium risk, and low risk values.
-	In the **Last Generated Report** column, click **View Report**.
<!-- Image 3-->
-	The **Comprehensive Assessment** report is displayed on the **Reports** tab.
-	In the upper right corner, view the target name, when the database was assessed, and the database version.
<!-- Image 4-->
-	View the values for the different risk levels. These values give you an idea of how secure your database is.
<!-- Image 5-->
-	View the values for security controls, user security, and security configurations. These totals show you the number of findings for each high-level category.
-	Browse the report by scrolling down and expanding and collapsing categories. Each category lists related findings about your database and how you can make changes to improve its security.
-	View the **Summary** table. This table compares the number of findings for each category and counts the number of findings per risk level. It helps you to identify the areas that need attention on your database.
<!-- Image 6-->
### **Step 2:** 
-	At the top of the report, click **Medium Risk** to filter the report to show only the medium risk findings.
-	Deselect all other risk levels.

-	Deselect all other risk levels.
-	Review the low risk findings.
-	At the top of the report, click **Advisory** to filter the report to show only the advisory findings.
-	Deselect all other risk levels.
-	Review the advisory findings.
### **Step 3:** 
-	At the top of the report, click **Evaluate** to filter the report to show only the Evaluate findings.
<!-- Image 7-->
-	Deselect all other risk levels.
-	Scroll through the report to view the findings.
-	Focus on **System Privilege Grants** under Privileges and Roles:
-	System privileges (ALTER USER, CREATE USER, DROP USER) can be used to create and modify other user accounts, including the ability to change passwords. This ability can be abused to gain access to another user's account, which may have greater privileges. The Privilege Analysis feature may be helpful to determine whether or not a user or role has used account management privileges.
-	Security Assessment found 59 grants of system privilege grants on your target database.
<!-- Image 8-->
<!-- Maybe add in the Evil Rich part-->

### **Step 4:** 
- At the top of the report, click **Advisory** to filter the report to show only the Advisory findings.

-	To compare the results with the first assessment, do the following:
-	Click the **Reports** tab.
-	Click **Security Assessment**.
-	Click **Comprehensive Assessments**.
-	Click the previous assessment report to open it.
-	**Note:** Currently, there's no compare functionality in the product so to compare assessment results, you need to view both reports and manually compare.

## Part 3. Assess Users with Oracle Data Safe
-	Using Oracle Data Safe, assess user security in your target database by using the User Assessment feature and fix issues.

### **Step 1:** 
-	Navigate to the Oracle Data Safe Service Console
-	In the Oracle Data Safe Console, click the **Home** tab, and then click **User Assessment**. The User Assessment page is displayed.
<!-- Image 3.1-->
- Select the check box for your target database, and click Assess.
<!-- Image 3.2-->
-	Wait for the report to generate.
-	When the report is generated, view the totals in the Critical Risk, High Risk, Medium Risk, and Low Risk columns.
-	In the Last Generated Report column, click View Report. The User Assessment report is displayed.
<!-- Image 3.3-->

### **Step 2:** 
-	View the **User Risk** chart. This chart compares the number of critical, high, medium, and low risk users.

## Part 4. Discover Sensitive Data with Oracle Data Safe
### **Step 1:** 
-	Navigate to the Oracle Data Safe Service Console
-	To access the **Data Discovery** wizard, click the **Home** tab, and then click **Data Discovery**.
<!-- Image 4.1-->
-	On the Select Target for Sensitive Data Discovery page, your target database is listed.
-	Often, you want to perform data discovery against a production database where you can get an accurate and up-to-date picture of your sensitive data. You can discover sensitive data in the source database (a production or copy) and mask the cloned copies of this source database. Or, you can simply run a data discovery job on the actual database that you want to mask.
-	Select your target database, and then click **Continue**.
<!-- Image 4.2-->
-	Next, the **Select Sensitive Data Model** page is displayed. On this page, you can create a new sensitive data model, select an existing one from the Library, or import a file-based sensitive data model.
<!-- Image 4.3-->
-	Leave **Create** selected.
-	Name the sensitive data model as **SDM1**.
-	Enable **Show and save sample data** so that Data Discovery retrieves sample data for each sensitive column, if it's available.
-	Select your resource group.
-	Click **Continue**.
-	On the **Select Schemas for Sensitive Data Discovery** page, select the schema that you want Data Discovery to search. In this case, select the **HCM1** schema, and click **Continue**.
<!-- Image 4.4-->
-	On the **Select Sensitive Types for Sensitive Data Discovery** page, you select the sensitive types that you want to discover. Data Discovery categorizes its sensitive types as Identification Information, Biographic Information, IT Information, Financial Information, Healthcare Information, Employment Information, and Academic Information. Do the following:
-	**Expand all** the categories by moving the Expand All slider to the right to view each sensitive type. Notice that you can select individual sensitive types, sensitive categories, and all sensitive types.
-	Scroll down the list and review the sensitive types available.
<!-- Image 4.5-->
-	Return to the top of the list and select the **Select All** check box.
-	At the bottom of the page, select the **Non-Dictionary Relationship Discovery** check box.
-	Oracle Data Safe automatically discovers referential relationships defined in the data dictionary. The **Non-Dictionary Relationship Discovery** feature helps to identify application-level parent-child relationships that are not defined in the data dictionary. It helps discover application-level relationships so that data integrity is maintained during data masking.
-	When you are ready to start the data discovery job, click **Continue**.
-	Wait for the job to finish.
<!-- Image 4.6-->
-	If the job is successful, the **Detail** column states Data discovery job finished successfully, and you can click **Continue**. Otherwise, you need to click **Back** or **Exit** and investigate the issue.

### **Step 2:** 
-	On the **Non-Dictionary Referential Relationships** page, you are presented with a list of potential non-dictionary (application level) referential relationships that Data Discovery found by using column name patterns and column data patterns. Do the following:
-	To view all of the columns, move the **Expand All** slider to the right. Data Discovery found some potentially sensitive columns (non-dictionary referential relationships) in the PU_PETE schema.
<!-- Image 4.7-->
-	Click **Save** and **Continue**.
-	The **Sensitive Data Discovery Result** page is displayed. On this page, you can view and manage the sensitive columns in your sensitive data model. Your sensitive data model is saved to the Library.
<!-- Image 4.8-->
-	Notice that Data Discovery found sensitive columns in all three sensitive categories that you selected. To view the sensitive columns, move the **Expand All** slider to the right. The list includes the following:
-	Sensitive columns discovered based on the sensitive types that you selected
-	Dictionary-based referential relationships
-	Non-dictionary referential relationships
-	Take a look at how the sensitive columns are organized. Initially, they are grouped by sensitive categories and sensitive types.
-	To list the sensitive columns by schema and table, select **Schema View** from the drop-down list next to the **Expand All Slider**. **Schema View** is useful for quickly finding a sensitive column in a table and for viewing the list of sensitive columns in a table. For example, in the EMPLOYEES table there are several sensitive columns listed.
-	If needed, you can add and remove sensitive columns from your sensitive data model. Sensitive columns that have a check box are removable. To remove a sensitive column from your sensitive data model, you deselect its check box. You can use the **Add** button to add more sensitive columns.
-	Notice that some of the sensitive columns do not have a check box. These are dependent columns. They have a relationship with their parent column. For example, in the EMPLOYEES table, JOB_ID is listed. It has a relationship defined in the Oracle data dictionary to the JOBS.JOB_ID sensitive column. If you remove a sensitive column that has a referential relationship, both the sensitive column and referential relationship are removed from the sensitive data model. Therefore, if you deselect JOBS.JOB_ID, then EMPLOYEES.JOB_ID is removed too.
-	View the sample data for the HCM1.SUPPLEMENTAL_DATA.LAST_INS_CLAIM column.
-	The sensitive type is **Healthcare Provider** and the discovered sensitive column is LAST_INS_CLAIM, which has values such as Cavity and Hair Loss. Your value may be different. This column isn't a Healthcare Provider type of column and thus it is a false positive. You can deselect this column. Being able to remove a sensitive column is important when your sensitive data model includes false positives. To be able to recognize false positives, it helps to know your data well.

-	**Tip:** To quickly locate a sensitive column, enter the name or part of the name in the search box.

### **Step 3:** 
-	Suppose that you're missing some sensitive columns in your sensitive data model. While working in the Data Discovery wizard, you can backtrack to reconfigure and rerun the data discovery job. You can repeat the process as many times as you need until you feel that your sensitive data model is accurate. Try the following:

-	Click **Back** 
-	Now you are on the **Select Sensitive Types for Sensitive Data Discovery** page. Here you can change your sensitive type selections and choose whether to include non-dictionary referential relationships in the search.
-	Select all of the sensitive categories.
<!-- Image 4.9-->
-	Deselect **Non-Dictionary Relationship Discovery**.
<!-- Image 4.10-->
-	To rerun the data discovery job, click **Continue**.
-	When the job is finished, click **Continue**. Because you chose to not discover non-dictionary referential relationships, the wizard takes you directly to the **Sensitive Data Discovery Result** page.
-	Expand all of the sensitive columns and review the results.
<!-- Image 4.11-->
-	To view the newly discovered sensitive columns, click **View newly discovered sensitive columns only**. Notice that Data Discovery found additional sensitive columns.

### **Step 4:** 
-	Scroll down and click Report at the bottom right corner of the screen.
The report shows you a chart that compares sensitive categories. You can also view totals of sensitive values, sensitive types, sensitive tables, and sensitive columns. The table at the bottom of the report displays individual sensitive column names, sample data for the sensitive columns, column counts based on sensitive categories, and estimated data counts.
<!-- Image 4.12-->
-	Analyze the data:
-	To drill-down into a sensitive category in the chart, position your mouse over the chart, and then click the **Expand** button.
<!-- Image 4.13-->
-	To drill-up, position your mouse over an expanded sensitive category, and then click the **Collapse** button.
-	To enlarge the chart, click the **Expand** button (double-arrows) in the bottom right corner. View the chart and click **Close**.
-	Expand the list of sensitive columns and review the information.
<!-- Image 4.14-->
-	Click **Exit**.
<!-- Image 4.15-->
-	To access the report from the Reports tab, do the following:
-	Click the **Reports** tab.
<!-- Image 4.16-->
-	Scroll down, and under **Discovery Reports**, click **Data Discovery**.
-	Click your sensitive data model to open the report.

### **Step 5:** 
-	Click the **Library**  tab.
-	Click **Sensitive Data**  Models.
-	The Sensitive Data Models page is displayed, listing the sensitive data models to which you have access. For each sensitive data model, you can view information about when your sensitive data model was created, when it was last updated, and who owns it.
<!-- Image 4.17-->
-	Click the name of your sensitive data model to open it.

<!-- Image 4.18-->
-	To return to the **Sensitive Data Models** page, click the **Library** tab, and then click **Sensitive Data Models**.
-	If you need to remove your sensitive data model from the Library, you can select the check box for it, and click **Delete**.


### **Step 6:** 
- Select the check box for your sensitive data model.
- Click **Download**. Your sensitive data model is downloaded to your browser.
- Open the file, and review the XML code.
- Save the file to your desktop as **SDM1.xml**, and then close the file.

## Part 5. Verify Sensitive Data Model with Oracle Data Safe
- Using Oracle Data Safe, verify a sensitive data model by using the verification option in the Library and by using the Data Discovery wizard.
